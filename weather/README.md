# APP WEATHER

## INTRO

This project was created using Vite, developed with React and Typescript.

This app allows users to check weather forecast for a specific city for the next 24hs or for the next 7 days.

User has 5 credits to search weather up to 5 times. After that, they must suscribe to keep doing queries.

If you need to check further documentation of the project, go to './docs' directory and run the 'index.html' file inside, in a Live Server.

To run the app, clone the repository on your computer.

The app gets data from open weather api. In order to use the app, you must register and get an api key here: https://openweathermap.org/

Once you have a valid api key, you must create a .env file in the root directory of the project and save your api key as follows:

VITE_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = your-api-key
